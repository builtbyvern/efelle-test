# A lil' something for Efelle

Based of the file given...

Notes:

- I've forgone a class-based padding system and instead set each section up differently. Tracking, line-height and padding were all over the map and I intentionally chose to mimic the design over my preferred approach of using a reliable and consistent system.

- The Message box for the contact form has the incorrect placeholder in the design. Since this was a test of how well I code and follow what I've been given, I've left the placeholder as "Email Address" instead of "Message". If I was coding this out, I'd definitely stop to have a conversation with the designer / PM.
